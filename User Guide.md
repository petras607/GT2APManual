# Foreword
The manual has been tested using the NTSC-U version of the game. I have made an effort to make names of certain items apply to NTSC-U and PAL versions of the game, although if you're a PAL player you may need to do some more tweaking on your own. I can't guarantee the manual's compatibility with NTSC-J version of the game.

Gran Turismo 2 Manual's general progression assumes you'll be starting the game from a fresh save file. Depending on settings though you may want to prepare your save file (either via cheats or revisiting a finished playthrough) to make Manual experience as smooth as possible:
| Option | Preparation |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled "License Tests" locations | Obtain every license available |
| Enabled "Arcade Mode" locations | Win every race in Arcade mode |
| Disabled "Limit Starter Cars" option | Have ~5 million credits |

# Rules of the game
Each event is a location. Obtain licenses to unlock more events. Obtain permits to be able to use more cars in said events. Obtain upgrades to apply on cars to make them stronger and win events more easily.

The goal is clearing one of the three milestone of GT League, residing in Simulation Mode's Go Race tab.

# Items
## Progressive License (progression)
Unlocks events in Simulation Mode and Arcade Mode. The number of obtained license items applies to the following:
| Count | License | Arcade Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | No license | Arcade Tier 1 |
| 1 | B-Class license | Arcade Tier 2 |
| 2 | A-Class license | Arcade Tier 3 |
| 3 | iC-Class license | Arcade Tier 4 |
| 4 | iB-Class license | Arcade Tier 5 |
| 5 | iA-Class license | Arcade Tier 6 |
| 6 | S-Class license | Arcade Tier 7 |

## Trophy (progression)
MacGuffins of this .apworld. Can be enabled using .yaml options. Once enabled, your picked victory condition will additionally require collecting a certain number of trophies. The number of available and required trophies can be adjusted.

## Milestone (progression)
Dummy items marking important milestones of GT League progression. Pre-placed in "Win All Nationals Events", "Win All Euro-Pacific Events" and "Win GT World League" locations. Getting a milestone associated with your picked vicotry condition wins the game.

## Manufacturer permits (progression)
You start the run with a random permit. Each car manufacturer available in-game has its own permit. By getting a permit you obtain permission to use said manufacturer's cars in Simulation Mode and Arcade Mode events. For example, if you get a Toyota Permit, you'll be able to use Toyota cars in your run.

## Upgrades
Unlocks an upgrade, allowing you to purchase them for your cars. Some upgrades may not be available in certain cars. If a car comes with upgrades already installed, you may use them on that car even if you didn't unlock them yet.

# Locations
## Simulation Mode
Nearly every event has a horsepower limit. A car has to have its horsepower equal or under the limit to be eligible. Certain events may also require a car to have specific drivetrain, engine aspiration or upgrades applied.
### GT League
The most important events are hosted there. Win all events in a category to obtain milestones. Getting a milestone associated with your victory condition wins the game.
### Special Events
A variety of races focused on different types of cars.
### Rally Events
Time attack against ghosts on dirt courses. Requires cars with Dirt Racing Tires installed on them.
### Endurance
Extremely long races, each one taking 1-2 hours to finish. Tire durability is enabled in these events.
### License Tests
Short time trials meant to test and improve your driving skills.
### Manufacturer Events
Races dedicated to a specific family of cars. Normal Style events ban race modified cars, while Racing Style events require race modified cars.

## Arcade Mode
Located on a separate disc from Simulation Mode. You can use either a premade selection of cars divided into multiple classes or use your own cars from Simulation garage. The higher your license is, the more events will be available there.
### Road Race
Regular race against opponents. Reversed variants of tracks can also be enabled, but unlocking them in-game requires winning races on highest difficulty.
### Rally
Set a best lap time on dirt courses. Cars imported from Simulation garage require Dirt Racing Tires for participation.
### Time Trial
Set a best lap time on road courses. Reversed variants of tracks can also be enabled, but unlocking them in-game requires winning races on highest difficulty in Road Race. Includes tracks not available for regular races.

# Options
## Goal
Set the end point of your run. All of these are located in GT League tab in Simulation Mode.
- GT World League - Win GT World League. The full playthrough.
- Euro-Pacific League - Win Euro-Pacific League. Medium length.
- Nationals - Win Nationals. Short length.
## Trophy Hunt

- Strict - Limits manufacturers to those with strong cars costing under 10,000 credits.
- Loose - Limits manufacturers to those with cars costing under 10,000 credits, regardless of their strength. Bad permit roll can make early game much more difficult.
- None - Anything can be your starting car. Requires a save file with a lot of credits saved up.
## Simulation Head Start
Adds a small bundle of upgrades to starting items to make early game a bit easier.
## Progressive Tires
Makes Tires progressive instead of being individual item for every type.
## Special Events
Adds Special Events to the location pool. Extremely slow.
## License Tests

- None - Disables manufacturer events.
## Arcade Mode
Adds Arcade Mode to the location pool. Requires disc juggling. Slows down the seed significantly.
## Arcade Time Trials
Adds Arcade time trials to the location pool. Slightly slows down the seed. Does nothing if Arcade is disabled.
## Arcade Reverse

- Both - Adds reversed tracks to both Road Race and Time Trial.
- Race - Adds reversed tracks to Road Race only.
- Time Trial - Adds reversed tracks to Time Trial only.

## Death Link
When you die, everyone who enabled death link die. Of course, the reverse is true too. Game doesn't have a restart button, so only viable for emulators. Examples of possible death link scenarios:
- Failing and restarting a license test
- Finishing a race below a certain position
- Going into pit lanes and changing tires

# Tips and tricks
- Each manufacturer has its own upgrade shop which only allow buying upgrades for their own cars. Use this to learn which manufacturer your car falls into.
- Increasing horsepower isn't the only way to make cars faster. Reducing weight, putting better tires, improving drivetrain and other upgrades are just as good for your car's performance.
- Manufacturer permits are divided into categories. There are separate categories for drivetrain, engine aspiration, upgrade compatibility and even whether they have cars eligible for lightweight events. Use them to quickly filter through your permits and find what you can use.
- If a location doesn't say "win" you might as well finish on last place. Of course, you can self-impose limitations to that anyway.
- Once you win a championship you can tick off every check belonging to that championship.
- You have a permit for FR, MR or 4WD cars and all licenses necessary, but you still can't do some checks in these drivetrain events? Don't worry, it's not a bug. The cars you have access to may have too much horsepower to qualify for them. Keep playing until you get other permits.
- Race modified cars you can win from events or buy directly from shops are perfect for getting stuff out of logic.
- Default .yaml template is configured with settings recommended for a casual full playthrough of the game.
- Special Events, License Tests, Manufacturer Events and Arcade are the only places with events that don't require any licenses, thus making your Sphere 1 available. Keep that in mind and have at least one of these options enabled.
- Try to have at least 92 locations enabled. Less than that and you'll risk failing generation.
- Be mindful when adding locations to your run. If you enable multiple additional location options, I strongly recommend enabling Trophy Hunt and adding some trophies to the item pool. This will reduce the amount of junk items generated by this game.
- It bears repeating, but if you decide to enable manufacturer events and/or lift starter car limitations, you really should have more than a few million credits on your save file first. It will save you a headache of grinding money for new cars and applying race modifications to them.
